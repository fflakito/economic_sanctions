# Impact of economic sanctions

## Can we predict the success of economic sanctions?
(group work, ~15h)

**Notes**:
- Relatively clean data
- Small dataset, especially considering that several lines can all relate to a single campain (and that the dataset spans over a century)
- imbalanced dataset (few successful sanctions)

**Results**:
- In [this notebook](https://github.com/fflakito/economic_sanctions/blob/master/final.ipynb).
